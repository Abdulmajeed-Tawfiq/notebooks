Just like a house needs a strong foundation, walls, and a roof, websites also need basic building blocks to stand strong. HTML is like the framework of a house - it gives structure to web pages.\n\nIn Islamic architecture, we see beautiful mosques with precise geometric patterns and carefully planned layouts. Similarly, web development requires attention to detail and thoughtful organization. Just as these sacred spaces serve their communities, the websites we build can benefit others.\n\n<img src=\"./images/mosque.jpeg\" width=\"200px\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" />\n\n#### Think of HTML tags as special containers, each with a specific purpose, just like different rooms in a house serve different functions.","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"attachments":{}},{"id":"22178fd2-3f2e-45f2-b477-5a70f2161c88","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### 1.

It means \"This is an HTML page.\" \n\n3. **`<head>`**: This part has information about the page, like its title. \n\n4. **`<title>The Pillars of Iman</title>`**: This sets the title of the page. It shows up on the browser tab. \n\n5. **`<body>`**: This is where all the visible stuff on the page goes. 👀\n\n6. **`<h1>`**: This is a big heading that says \"The Six Pillars of Iman.\" It’s the main title on the page. \n\n7. **`<p>`**: This is a paragraph that gives a little info about the Pillars of Iman. \n\n8. **`<ul>`**: This starts a list. Inside it, we have:\n   - **`<li>`**: Each of these tags is a list item. They show the six important beliefs.\n   - **`<strong>`**: to make the text inside it bold.\n\n9. **`<a>`**: This is a link. It says \"Islamic Finder,\" and if you click it, it takes you to a website (note that the link will open in a new tab **can you guess why?** 😉)\n\n10. **`<img>`**: This tag shows a picture. It has a description (alt text) in case the picture doesn’t load.\n\n11. **`<form>`**: This is a form where you can enter your name and email. \n    - **`<input>`**: These are the boxes where you type your name and email. \n    - **`<label>`**: This tells you what to type in each box. \n\n12. **`<input type=\"submit\">`**: This is a button you can click to send the information. \n\n13. **`<input disabled>`**: This is a box that you can’t type in.
